    <h2>Heya!</h2>
    <p>This is a boring welcome page where I'm not yet sure what to put up yet.
    Most likely, this page will get the latest updates/blogposts/articles
    published by me. But since my clientside CMS scripts aren't primetime yet,
    this obligatory annoying welcome page will just sit here.
    
    <div class=specialSection><h3>Special</h3><p>This is a special section 
    with content emphasizing some stuff to explain further. Isn't it just 
    awesomely awesome? Thought so, too.</p></div>

    <h2>Why these fonts?</h2>
    <p class=firstpar>I use the PT Mono and Open Sans fonts on this website. This article tries to
    explain why it is not merely a matter of taste, but a matter of functional
    design and UI usability choices.</p>

    <h3>Open Sans</h3>
    <p>Open Sans is a font licensed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache License 2.0</a>,
    designed by <a href="https://profiles.google.com/107777320916704234605/about">Steve Matteson</a>.
    It natively supports font weights of 300, 400, 600, 700, 800. Some of those 
    weights also have an italic variant.</p> 
    
    <h4>Serif versus sans-serif</h4>
    <p>Serif and sans-serif fonts both have their place. The problem with serif 
    fonts is that the process of recognizing characters by humans can be problematic
    on computer screens.
    For plain text, a screen uses about 12 to 20 pixels to render a character. 
    Serifs for these amounts of pixels are not very clear. This distorts the actual 
    rendering as offset to the intended rendering. Paper and printers together use 
    much more pixels for the same physical character size. Serifs printed on paper
    therefore are much better recognizable.</p>
    
    <h4>Helvetica ancestor</h4>
    <p>Open Sans is a further iteration over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica">Helvetica</a>. 
    The clarity of Helvetica
    was revolutionary in the 50's, where the font was massively adopted by many
    typesetters and logo designers. At that time, the typesetting industry mainly
    used fonts derived from handwriting, or heavy-serif fonts. A great example of 
    this is a coca cola ad, shown here.</p>
    
    <img class=illustration src="img/fontDecision/cocacola.jpg">
    
    <p>The logo itself (still) uses the handwriting derived font, and the supporting 
    text is a serif font with "heavy serifs". The text with the big red "T" is 
    barely readable. A sans-serif font
    used here would have made the text a lot simpler to read, when the same image 
    resolution and font size is applied.</p>
    
    <h4>Screen resolution</h4>
    <p>Today, most screens don't have many pixels available for font rendering. 
    The good newss is that this fact is rapidly becoming outdated. The new iPad
    has a resolution of 2048×1536 pixels crammed on a 9.7" inch screen, a pixel
    density of 264 PPI. Compared to an iPad of the previous generation, it has double
    the amoun of pixels available to render the same character. Instead of 12-20
    pixels, suddenly 24-4- pixels are available! Finding user stories on the web
    of people experiencing very crisp and clear font redendering on the new iPad
    is trivial, hundreds of those stories are within one google query.</p>
    
    <div class=specialSection>
    	<h3>iPads screens</h3>
    	<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
    		<tr><th></th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th></tr>
    		<tr><td>resolution</td><td>1024×768</td><td>1024×768</td><td>2048×1536</td></tr>
    		<tr><td>ppi</td><td>132</td><td>132</td><td>264</td></tr>
    	</table>
    </div>
    
    <p>Not only the new iPad uses a high pixel density, also desktop computer screens
    increasingly get bigger screens with higher pixel densities. Personally, I use
    the zoom feature of my browsers quite often, to normalize the content character
    size among the websites I read. This screens-get-bigger-and-crisper argument
    further undermines the anti- serif argument.</p>
    
    <p>However, the fact is that most screens today still use an pixel density where
    serif fonts are not appropriate. Designers still fight for every pixel they
    can get. When the mainstream of users have most of their devices with high
    pixel densities, the serif fonts can be used again. Until that time, defaulting
    on sans-serif font use should make users more happy when they consume your 
    content</p>
    
    <h4>Font size</h4>
    <p>12-20 pixels given top render a character is only given to the font renderer
    to "content text". For titles, banners et cetera, where larger font sizes are
    used, the problem of unclear serifs is much less present. Depending on how the
    serifs are designed on the font and depending on the rendered font size, enough 
    screen estate can be present to render the serif font without any unclarity
    or rendering artefacts may appear.</p> 
    
    <h3>PT Mono</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/PT+Mono">PT Mono</a> is 
    a monospaced font explicitly designed to avoid ambuigity of characters. 
    Alexandra Korolkova designed PT Mono, with participation of Isabella Chaeva 
    and with the financial support of Google Web Fonts. From the Google Web Fonts 
    webpage:
    <blockquote>PT Mono was developed for specific uses in forms, tables, worksheets and 
    other contexts.</blockquote>
    
    <h4>Code</h4>
    <p>Programming languages make heavy use of the ascii character set. Many
    characters in this character set are very similar, and thus burdens the user
    in performing recognition. The classical example for this is the lowercase o,
    uppercase O and the number zero 0. Fonts not adding distinct features
    between said characters, make it uneccesary hard for the code reader to comprehend
    the computer code. In certain situations it may even lead to hard to detect 
    bugs. </p>
    
    <p>A font displaying computer code therefore should be explicitly designed for
    readability. It's a known fact that computer code gets read 10× more often than
    it is written. Impeccable clarity and nonambigious characters therefore are
    a hard requirement. Code editors often use the italics and bold veriants to
    hint the user certain aspects of the code interpretation, and as such should be 
    supported.</p>

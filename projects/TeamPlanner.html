    employees.
    <div class=specialSection>
    <h3>Sensitive information</h3>
    <p>This article only contains a very small subset of the information of the 
    project. Most information (like the internship report) is packed with privacy
    sensitive data, and proprietary business processes. This page exists to give
    you an idea what the project was about, and what the result is. Excusez-moi!</p> 
    </div>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>Develop and design a new "team pipeline" which supports the current 
    scheduling process. This should be done by the <i>Avanade Connected Methods</i>
     project management method. 
    Information should be fast and easily accessible. Prerequisites for this 
    project are furthermore that it should be developed in Visual Studio 
    Team System, the Microsoft .NET framework, Microsoft Sharepoint and Microsoft
     Project (Server). </p>

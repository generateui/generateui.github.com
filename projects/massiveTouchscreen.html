    <h2>Massive Touchscreen</h2>
    <p class=firstpar>A touchscreen using a projector, Wii remote, and a special pen with a LED,
    illuminating on pressure. </p>

    <h3>Time</h3>
    This project is performed in 2005, just before the iPhone brought multitouch 
    to the mainstream. This article is for archival purposes only.

    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>Build a massive touchscreen using off-the-shelf cheap components for fun.</p>
    
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>A semi-transparent top of an IKEA table is placed vertically. A projector
    with advanced image controls, like vertical/horizontal flip, projects a computer
    video feed on the back of the tabletop. A Wii remote is attached to the projector,
    detecting infrared light emitted from the LED on the tip of the customized pen. The
    Wii remote sends coordinates of the detected light using bluetooth to the computer
    sending out the video feed. The pressure sensitive tip of the pen acted as a 
    left-mouse-click. A glove with LEDs attached on fingertips, </p>
    
    <h3>Software</h3> 
    <p><a href="http://www.smoothboard.net/">Smoothboard</a> was used to control 
    the mouse pointer using the received Wii remote input. Although this worked, 
    using the possibilities of multitouch to it's full potential posed problems.
    Integration was nonexistent in Windows in 2005. The .NET framework introduced 
    a first implementation of a multitouch/pen-input API with version 3.</p>
    
    <p>The most fun was playing games like Command & Conquer, and having every guest
    person draw something in MS Paint using the touchscreen device.</p>
    
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <h4>Looking into the light</h4>
    <p>The main problem with the setup was looking onto the image itself. As you 
    stand in front of the screen, you look into a 2500W lightbulb, of which a great
    part of the light shines through the semi-transparent glass. After working for 
    about half an hour on the screen, headache and dry eyes where not uncommon.
    The projector had the ability to lower the light intensity, but for this to work,
    the room needed darkening to keep enough contrast.</p>
    
    <h4>Large</h4>
    <p>The setup was built into a standard shipping container, in where I lived for
    two years (along with ~2000 other students). The setup took about 2m50 by 3m50
    for the total surface area, with the screen pontifical in the middle of the 
    container.</p>
    
    <h4>Software</h4>
    <p>Most software was not build for use with (multi)touch in mind. Swiping, 
    pinching et cetera could be manually built/implemented using scripts. Opera was a notable
    exception to this (in 2005!) where it was child's play to control the web 
    browser by touch commands.</p>

		very handy when adjusting the distance of the projector to the screen.</figcaption>
